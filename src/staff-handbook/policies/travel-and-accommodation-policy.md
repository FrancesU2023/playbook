## Travel and Accommodation Policy

Currently, the default for everyone in the organisation is working from home.

For this period, we will consider regular travel to an office space without a business critical need as commuting.

Commuting costs are the responsibility of individuals, while dxw will fund business critical travel and accommodation.

A business critical need is defined as:

* client meetings
* meetings with your line manager (e.g. during probation, monthly check-ins, quarterly reviews, post parental / sick leave)
* team meetups (e.g. design community, tech forum, away days, Board meetings)
* all-staff in-person events
* Conferences and training events

At present, there is no obligation to attend in-person meetings.

As with all company expenses, please keep in mind that costs should be necessary and proportionate. We rely on everyone to be conscious of the impact of their travel on the environment. If you are able to take public transport, over being driven/driving yourself, please do.

Accommodation will be covered for business-critical events that require overnight stays.

There are [guidelines in the Expenses policy that include rates and a list of recommended hotels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCNkW_wgJ_CDKXGNwdcsx64-F2AZtbfML7_Tb_PvDRA/edit).

Accommodation should be booked by the individual on a Pleo company debit card or expensed.

Any decision that this policy does not clearly resolve, should be made by the appropriate director.
