Anytime you need to order something or experience a problem with your working
set up you can find guidance in the Playbook, through a ‘help’ slack channel or
from your line manager who can point you in the right direction.

## Helpful Slack channels

  purchasing form. Additional questions can be asked through the channel.

  [expenses policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCNkW_wgJ_CDKXGNwdcsx64-F2AZtbfML7_Tb_PvDRA/edit#)

## Equipment guidance

We can support you with your home-office set-up, including things like a desk,
monitor and keyboard. Here's a
[guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Q8zOEm4cd0ZDGqkT8Bcg8G1CCK_vLlwMtOFVgJalAU/edit#heading=h.1z3dei2pr1jh)
which shows what we can support with.

## Claiming expenses

From time to time, some of us spend our own money at work. Most often, this is
things like:

- Train fares for unexpected travel
- Refreshments purchased for meetings with clients
- Stationery/materials, especially for workshops or events

dxw will always pay expenses which are:

- **Necessary**: We only expense things we need in order to be able to complete
  our work.
- **Proportionate**: The total expense should be proportionate to the work at
  hand. In general, we try to avoid spending lots of money. For example, unless
  you have a good reason, don't get a cab to a meeting when you could get a
  train.

Wherever possible, it's best to check that expenses can be reclaimed before
incurring them.

We manage expenses using Xero. For more information about how to do this, see
the [guide on claiming expenses](claiming-expenses/)
