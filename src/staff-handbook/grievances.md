If you have a grievance about your employment or a complaint about another
member of staff, talk to the Managing Director as soon as possible.

The first step is to discuss the problem to see if it can be quickly resolved.

If this discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the problem, you should put
details of your grievance in writing and send it to the CEO. They
will arrange a meeting to discuss the matter, at which you may be accompanied by
a colleague or trade union official. Following this discussion the CEO will provide a written response.

If you disagree with this response or the matter remains unresolved, you may
appeal by responding in writing. A further meeting will be arranged and the CEO will again respond in writing. This decision will be final.
