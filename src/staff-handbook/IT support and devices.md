## Calendars and documents

We use Google Workspace to manage calendars, write and share documents. There is
a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't see it
when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send you the
link, and then click "Add to drive".

When we write new things, we try to save them in a sensible folder within the
existing structure.

## Internal tech support

If you experience problems with laptops, wi-fi, tools, etc, post a message in
the **\#help-internal-tech-support** Slack channel.

## Using a personal device at work

Most of us use at least one personal device as part of our work, because it's
more convenient than carrying lots of devices around. However, no one is
obligated to use a personal device for work. If you need a dxw-provided phone,
tablet or other device, please ask for one.

Anyone who does use a personal device must take reasonable care to ensure that
it cannot compromise dxw's security. This includes implementing prudent security
measures, being mindful that your personal devices could be targeted as part of
an attack on dxw or its clients. For example, you might receive an email to your
personal email address designed to trick you into revealing a work-related
password.

Exactly what security measures are prudent may vary depending on the device and
what you're using it for. Some good practice examples are:

- Configuring screens to lock after a period of inactivity
- Ensuring that work-related data on the device is regularly backed up
- Encrypting storage
- Using good passwords and changing defaults
- Avoiding connecting devices to untrustworthy networks (internet cafes,
  security conferences, unencrypted (open) WiFi networks, etc)
- Disposing of your device securely when you no longer need it

If you need to use a personal device but cannot take these sorts of measures,
you should get permission first.
